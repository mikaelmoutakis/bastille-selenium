# Bastille-selenium
A Bastille jail template for a selenium-python-firefox webscraper. 

## What is this?
This is a template for the Bastille jail manager in FreeBSD. 
It installs a very basic webscraper written in python. 

This silly webscraper retrieves a list of currently supported FreeBSD releases from 
the projects webpage, and then waits one minute before trying again. 

## Who is this for?
Someone who wants a template for making their deployment script.  

## What is Bastille
A fantastic jail manager for FreeBSD. Jails fulfill a similar functions as linux containers.
