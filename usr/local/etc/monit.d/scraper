###### My monit config for the webscraper

check process scraper with pidfile /var/log/scraper/scraper.pid
    start program = "/usr/local/bin/scrape" with timeout 60 seconds
    stop program = "kill -9 `cat /var/log/scraper/scraper.pid`"
    if cpu > 60% for 2 cycles then alert
    if cpu > 95% for 5 cycles then restart
    if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then unmonitor
